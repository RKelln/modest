# Modest

A [markdown theme](https://markdowncss.github.io) that is rather modest. Based on [John Otander's ](http://johnotander.com) theme of the same name, but modified for my personal use.

Note that I have roughly updated some outdated packages, but there is still quite a bit of work to be done to modernize the dependencies. However, the css should be fine. 

## Installation

#### Through npm:

```
npm install --save markdown-modest
```

This theme integrates well with `rework-npm`, and has rework CSS available in the index.css file.

#### Clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/RKelln/modest
```

#### Development:

```
git clone https://github.com/RKelln/modest && cd modest
npm install
gulp
```

## Usage

Link the file in your Markdown to HTML build process:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/css/modest.css">
```
